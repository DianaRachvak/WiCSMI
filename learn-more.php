            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The drop off rate for women studing computer science or a related feild is an incredibly high. The female to male 
                ratio in the tech industry is unsatisfactory. With even the biggest company still making women in tech a rarity. Diversity 
                is best for soceity, children, and companies themselves. We believe through a community of supportive women, we can make a 
                difference. Our model has three pillars: empowerment through leadership roles, community of women of all ages, and insight
                into the field, as well as insight into the next generation. The community helps keep women in tech. Leadership 
                roles are offered to remind women they can do anything they want and help build their resumes with numerous skills. 
                Lastly, we hope that students who want to learn more about the tech-related industry get a chance to speak to women
                and learn from their experiences.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Women in Computer Science Mentorship Initiative, or WiCSMI, was founded in 2016 from the Women In Computer Science 
                Club on campus. The first Director was Chava Shulman, and she was incredibly instrumental to getting the initiative
                up and running. Chava worked closely with the Magner Career Center's Director, Natalia, to lay the foundation of the 
                initiative. Since then, there has been two Co-Directors running the program and it has been ever evolving based on 
                feedback we recieve.</p>
